Please answer the questions:

1.  What is M?

2.  What is the digital frequency \omega_0 of the interference that we are trying to knock out?

3.  Based on the DTFT of the FIR filter, does it appear as if it would remove \omega_0?

4.  What could be problematic about this filter and why is it actually not a huge deal?
